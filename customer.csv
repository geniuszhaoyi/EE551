The staff was completely unprofessional and actually annoying. Instead of serving their customers they were at the bar gossiping about fellow staff and customers while counting their money. One particularly annoying/inebriated waitress was actually told to go home. Seemed no manager was on duty.

I ordered the chicken soup $5 and salmon $22 for my daughter. The chicken soup was flavorful. I liked it. My daughter did not like it. The salmon wasnt cooked (raw inside). They took it back to cook it but it had a strong fishy smell and bad flavor. we love salmon but my daughter gave 2 thumbs down on the first 2 bites. My sister loved her meal.

I went for a family type bachelorette dinner for my sis in law. It was clearly a family dinner. Two mothers, an aunt, me, & my sis in law. It wasn't a bride with all of her friends looking for a night out. We were asked why my sis in law was wearing a tiara & we told them. When a man looking like he's the manager came up to us with shots of tequila for everyone, we were a little confused, but we looked past it. Should have taken this as a red flag, especially since I'm only 19 & I wasn't even carded. He was so upset 20 minutes later when he showed up & none of us drank those tequila shots. It was a nice gesture, but it was clearly a family dinner & I don't understand why he kept pushing us to take tequila shots, even offering to bring us more & then told us he'd drive us home. So weird. We left the restaurant & we split the payment into three equal parts-- two card & one cash. We told the waitress how we wanted to split it & she told us IT WAS OK. NOT ONCE DID SHE OPEN HER MOUTH TO TELL US IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. She returned our cards & the change in cash. We left happily. Nobody stopped us. No one said anything about our payment method. We were told to have a good night. Two of us, me & the aunt, stepped back in briefly because our parking pass wasn't working. The same man came up to us asking why we didn't pay the rest/ didn't leave tip. We left a good tip, too. Not just some spare change we had. When the aunt tried to explain how we paid, he kept walking away rudely, printing out the receipt, not even letting us speak. I knew for a fact that the change we got back was correct. He claimed only our card went through & we left no cash. So where was the cash we paid with? He told us to come back with the cash. Both of us left so astounded at the way he was speaking to us, especially since WE PAID. Literally two minutes after we stepped out, he chased us down saying that the ""bus boy found the money under the table."" He said WE dropped the money under the table. Please someone explain to me how does that even make sense if we were only handed back the change. This guy is a liar & the waitress who took our money was clearly trying to take that cash & keep it for herself. Little did she know we would come back for the parking ticket. Look, I work in customer service/food industry & I know how to act in these situations. I am a 19 year old girl & I could have handled this WAY better than this grown man. Don't blame us for your crappy & sneaky waiters. Clearly, this guy was super unprofessional. This restaurant is super sketch. He's lucky I didn't drink because I could have claimed he was giving alcohol to an underage. What a joke.",0,Jazmin L.

The food here was merely ""okay,"" although my Cubano sandwich was slightly undercooked, and the Morir Sonando for some reason was disguised as a yuppie frapp. Very disappointing.

We arrived about 20 minutes late because we pulled into the wrong lot & had to switch over the to correct one. We were told our table was given away after being 10 minutes late. We weren't called to be made aware of this. Ok, policy is policy. But they were so rude on top of it all. They said you can seat yourself at the bar if you want ""it's over there"". No effort at all to try to accommodate us. Will not be returning on a Saturday night!!! Better more accommodating places to go in Hoboken (I.e., zafras)!!!",0,Annette T.

The space Uptown feels airy and open compared to downtown. The food here is awesome with the classics like a Cuban sandwich and Ropa Vieja, but some others like the pork sandwiches and shrimp dishes are less expected and just as good. Unlike other Cuban places, the plantains are very flavorful and even the rice and beans are great. It's the perfect place for a filling lunch or a nice dinner.",0,Tyler L.

When I heard about their new uptown location, I decided I want to try it out to celebrate my birthday. My husband and I made reservations for Sunday brunch however it looks like it wasn't necessary to make a reservation because there were plenty of open tables when we were seated. My husband ordered the Omar's stuffed French toast (since it was featured in food network) and I opted for the omelette which you get to choose 3 fillings (I ordered chorizo, manchego cheese, and maduros). I almost went with the churrasco instead and kind of wish I had. The omelette was served with a small serving of their homefries (which were good) and Cuban toast (Yum). The French toast was ok but the strawberry overpowered the flavor. I was expecting more guava cheese and not so much strawberry. We also ordered 2 brunch cocktails which WERE STRONG! The passion fruit belini for me and el bucanero for my husband. I preferred his drink! Service was good. Fast and friendly. I found out to be really pricy but I've been spoiled by low cost delicious Cuban food in my north Hudson area. I can't say that I would come back but I would try the downtown location for lunch or dinner in the future.",0,Diana H.

This is not about the money, however I felt that the manager specifically was not consumer friendly. So as a family we decided to enjoy the cake at a members home, since it was clearly not something the restaurant wanted. The dinner and wait staff were excellent. I enjoyed my dinner and asked if I could get a little more of the Chimichuree sauce, which I did get. So when the check arrives there is an additional, though nominal fee for this tiny amount of the sauce. I was really feeling like this place will nickel and dime you to death.. I think they need to be more willling to serve the customer. I felt like the manager was doing us a favor. I did speak to him to see if he would reconsider, he did not.. Good luck moving uptown. I dont think they will last with these petty fees that by the way, are NOT on the menu. I wont go back. I wouldnt be surprised if they counted the ice cubes in the drink.

They have a counter to sit at and order from with tables surrounding them - I like that they have both options. Good menu and great food, but the service was so bad. Our waitress barely came to the table... took forever to order and then once we ordered (and gave our drink orders as well), didn't see or hear from her for about 30-40 minutes. Got 2 drinks and had to tell her when she brought our food out 30-40 minutes later that she forgot to bring them over. I'm sure I'll return eventually, but not that anxious to get back anytime soon.",0,Erin J.

It was pretty crowed but we managed to get seated quickly near the back kitchen area next to the bar. We saw our waiter 2 times that night. First time when he took our order, second time to take our check and apologize to us about how terrible the service was. I have to say the food was excellent but it took an incredibly long time for us to get our food, drinks and even when we tried to order dessert it took so long that we had to again wave down someone to cancel the dessert order because we had to get going. As all of this was going on I could see our waiter behind the bar/ in the kitchen talking and laughing with his staff, obviously too busy to help us with anything so the busy bartender and hostess kept coming over to get our drinks, desert and give us the check at the end of the meal. The entire time we felt like we were pulling teeth trying to get anyone's attention all the while, watching our waiter in the kitchen/ bar talking and doing nothing. It was busy that night but there's no excuse for that. The food was incredible so that would be the only thing that would bring me back. Maybe next time they will be better staffed.",0,Dina D.

Had chicken empanada. Best I've ever had. Full of flavor. No crazy ingredients. Had chicken soup and excellent. Intense chicken flavor in broth. Lots of perfectly cooked shredded chicken. Home made, not from a Panara soup bladder. Had steak milenesa. They wouldn't add eggs which was odd. However, may have been the most flavorful milenesa I've ever had. Very pleased. For dessert I had the coco flan. After a meal of great food, this flan took the crown. Perfect texture and flavor. Nice sauce. Ground coconut shavings on top with a cherry drizzle. Yummmmmmy. The yellow rice was subpar. The plantains were fine, but nothing special. Would go here again.",0,Andrew D.

I came back with my family for dinner on a Sunday and they ran out of every special, bread (so no sandwiches), roasted chicken,avocado- all of the basics. After ordering the waiter came back to us about 4 times because they kept ""running"" out of food. Keep in mind they had just opened at 5 pm and that is when we sat down. The manager was no help at all and stated he was upset with the limited amounts of food ( which isn't our problem!). How do you run out of food at 5pm. Will not return- horrible customer service!

We walked in on a Sunday night and were told they only had room for us at the counter. I'm actually a fan of sitting at the bar because I find that you normally get better service and most times a show. On this night everyone seems very busy and a bit overwhelmed. Our waiter took our drink order but the beer list wasn't updated so we had a bit of confusion when figuring out what to order. We opted for the arroz con pollo and half roasted chicken. Since our food was a special of the night it actually came out of a steam table which normally would terrify me but in this case the food was still delicious and the chicken moist and tender. Bae's chicken was also on point and it came with two sides. The tostones were hot and delicious but lacked in that delicious garlic sauce I'm accustomed to. We tried to be healthy by getting veggies but they were lathered in butter and garlic. ,0,David S.

We were told it was because it was the 4th July (!) but I think it was because the chef still cannot cope with a full menu. When I noticed people eating a Cuban sandwich at the bar I asked if they still had some and the waitress told me that it was available, why she didn't mention it when she offered us the menu is strange... Waitress was very sweet but all over the place, seemed very confused and stressed. Drinks are very, very weak and not worth the price, I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. I really want La Isla to be a success but they need to get their act together otherwise people will just walk to The Cuban or Havana. I will try again in a months time and hopefully things will be different. Hostess on our way out seemed a bit out of space and didn't even wished us a good night...",0,Roger P.
